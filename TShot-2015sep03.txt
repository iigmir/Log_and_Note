Running virtal machine. OS is WinMe. 
I plug my USB in, but fail.
"Is it because firmware?" I try to find answer.
There's someone ask same question on Vmware community.
Their answer is that change USB version in virtal machine setting.
I also try switch to ver 1.1, and it works!

But, well, why can't I use shared folder...?
