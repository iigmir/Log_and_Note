Question about Git.

I found that most people use Github with Git, so I installed Git.
Firstly I just install Git with Putty. However I found an Interface named TortoiseGit. 
Therefore, I reinstall Git.
But that's not ended: There're many old files in Github, so I remove and create new repo again. 
Just a hard work.
Then, I push, but fail. I just thaught it's because licence. 
Right it's a part of problem, but not only this one.

Finally I found that I must pull it before push...

Success, but little tired.

Well, I try to use Github for Windows...Little easier but still hard working, eh.
1.After repo created, put files to repo folder.
2.Check "Uncommited changes" appear or not.
3.Give uncommited changes name if appear.
4.Click "Commited changes".
Just for write till now...

Problem in Tutorials repo. I use Git on my Linux virtual machine. However, there's a little problem:
error: The requested URL returned error: 403 Forbidden

Looks like authentication problem.

How I solve?
[iigmir@iigmir Tutorial]$ git config -l | grep remote.origin.url
remote.origin.url=https://github.com/iigmir/Tutorial.git
[iigmir@iigmir Tutorial]$ git config remote.origin.url \
> "https://iigmir@github.com/iigmir/Tutorial.git"

That works, but is there any easier solution?

Postscript 0:
I found my config changed in .git/config ...try to delete "iigmir@"? Well, Fail. Truely this problem. Next time I will change "url" line in "[remote "origin"]" in ./git/config
But I need think other method to slove this problem fundamentally.

Postscript 1:
"git pull" first, then "git push"...I want to beat myself......
