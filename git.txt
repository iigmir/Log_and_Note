Question about Git.

I found that most people use Github with Git, so I installed Git.
Firstly I just install Git with Putty. However I found an Interface named TortoiseGit. 
Therefore, I reinstall Git.
But that's not ended: There're many old files in Github, so I remove and create new repo again. 
Just a hard work.
Then, I push, but fail. I just thaught it's because licence. 
Right it's a part of problem, but not only this one.

Finally I found that I must pull it before push...

Success, but little tired.
