Here's question about Git.
I found that most people use Github with Git, so I installed Git.

Firstly I just install Git with Putty. However I found an Interface named TortoiseGit. 
Therefore, I reinstall Git.



But that's not ended: There're many old files in Github, so I remove and create new repo again. 
Just a hard work.
Then, I push, but fail. I just thaught it's because licence. 
Right it's a part of problem, but not only this one.

Finally I found that I must pull it before push...

Success, but little tired.

1.After repo created, put files to repo folder.

2.Check "Uncommited changes" appear or not.

3.Give uncommited changes name if appear.

4.Click "Commited changes".
