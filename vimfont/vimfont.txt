My Vim in console messed when in non-English.

Firstly I think it's because encoding. So I try this:

set encoding=utf-8
set termencoding=utf-8
set fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,chinese,big5,gbk,sjis,defaul

But it's useless. Still messed. Maybe it's not because encoding.

Then I surf Internet, found someone says it may due to font.

Try to use gVim, it works! Well it must because console!

But how to show non-English text font in console?
